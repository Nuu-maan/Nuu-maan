> Building tools that make the web more powerful, one repo at a time.

I'm a full-stack developer.
My focus is on automation, APIs, bots, and backend-heavy systems.

### Currently Exploring:

* Reverse engineering
* WebSockets & real-time systems
* Scalable architecture

### Selected Projects

* [`chat-api`](https://github.com/Nuu-maan/chat-api)
  Real-time WebSocket chat API with persistent messaging support.

* [`URL-Shortener`](https://github.com/Nuu-maan/URL-Shortener)
  Sleek and simple web app for generating shortened links.

* [`Filly-Discord-Token-Filler`](https://github.com/Nuu-maan/Filly-Discord-Token-Filler)
  Automates Discord server joins using multiple tokens. Scripted and efficient.

* [`Discord-AI-Assistant`](https://github.com/Nuu-maan/Discord-AI-Assistant)
  Lightweight AI bot using OpenRouter's LLMs. Fast, flexible, and easy to integrate.

* [`ZeroShare`](https://github.com/Nuu-maan/ZeroShare)
  ZeroShare is a secure file drop system that lets you share files via end-to-end encrypted links — like Firefox Send. The server never sees your files or keys, so only the person with the link can open the file.

* [`DSA`](https://github.com/Nuu-maan/DSA)
  Comprehensive DSA practice repo with real interview questions, clean solutions in Python, JavaScript, and C++. Professionally organized by topic and difficulty. Perfect for coding interviews and mastering data structures & algorithms.
