> Building tools that make the web more powerful, one repo at a time.

I'm a full-stack developer focused on **automation, APIs, bots, and backend-heavy systems**.

### Currently Exploring

* Reverse engineering
* WebSockets & real-time systems
* Scalable architecture

### Selected Projects

* [`chat-api`](https://github.com/Nuu-maan/chat-api)
  Real-time WebSocket chat API with persistent messaging support.

* [`FastAPI Authentication Boilerplate`](https://github.com/Nuu-maan/FastAPI-Authentication-Boilerplate)
  Production-ready authentication starter for FastAPI with clean architecture, JWT (access/refresh via HttpOnly cookies), email verification, password reset, RBAC, sessions, and auditing.

* [`Filly-Discord-Token-Filler`](https://github.com/Nuu-maan/Filly-Discord-Token-Filler)
  Automates Discord server joins using multiple tokens. Scripted and efficient.

* [`Discord-AI-Assistant`](https://github.com/Nuu-maan/Discord-AI-Assistant)
